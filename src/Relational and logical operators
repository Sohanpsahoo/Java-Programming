Logical Operators :
Logical operators are used to provide logic to our Java programs.
There are three types of logical operators in Java :
&& - AND
|| - OR
! – NOT
AND Operator :
Evaluates to true if both the conditions are true.

Y && Y = Y
Y && N = N
N && Y = N
N && N = N
Convention: # Y – True and N - False

OR Operator :
Evaluates to true when at least one of the conditions is true.

Y || Y = Y
Y || N = Y
N || Y = Y
N || N = N
Convention: # Y – True and N - False

NOT Operator :
Negates the given logic (true becomes false and vice-versa)

!Y = N
!N = Y
