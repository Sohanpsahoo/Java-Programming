Multithreading in Java:
Multiprocessing and multithreading both are used to achieve multitasking

In a nut shell.......
1.threads use shared memory area
2.threads = faster content switching
3.A thread is light-weight where a process is heavyweight
   for example = A word processor can have one thread running in foreground as an editor and another in the background auto saving the document !

Flow of control in java:
1.Without  threading :

      Main()======>Funcn1()======>Func2()=======>END

2.With threading :

       Main()-----------------------|
                                    |
                                    |
                                    |
                                    |
                   Func1()------------------------=>>>>END
                                             |
                                             |
                                             |
                                             |
                           Func2()------------


   Creating a Threading:
   There are two ways to create a thread in java:

    1.By extending thread class
    2.By implementing Runnable interface
